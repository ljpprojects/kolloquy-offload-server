--- Recommended firewall configuration ---

TO               ACTION       FROM
--               ------       ----
22/tcp           ALLOW IN     $LAN_IPS         # Ideally you should only be able to access the server from LAN
443/tcp          ALLOW IN     $PROXY_IP        # Use a proxy which you trust (it will handle traffic from the whole internet)
ANYWHERE         ALLOW OUT    ANYWHERE         # There is no point in restricting egress
ANYWHERE (v6)    ALLOW OUT    ANYWHERE (v6)    # Make sure we don't accidentally restrict egress to IPv6 addresses

--- EXAMPLE VARIABLES ---

$LAN_IPS = 192.168.0.0/24
$PROXY_IP = 149.138.95.172

Therefore, the configuration would look something like this:

TO               ACTION       FROM
--               ------       ----
22/tcp           ALLOW IN     192.168.0.0/24
443/tcp          ALLOW IN     149.138.95.172
ANYWHERE         ALLOW OUT    ANYWHERE
ANYWHERE (v6)    ALLOW OUT    ANYWHERE (v6)
